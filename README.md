# CSE504-Fake_Review_Detection
This project is a part of the Information Retrieval course at IIIT Delhi and focuses on detecting fake reviews on online platforms. Fake reviews can significantly impact the reputation of a product or service, and it is essential to identify and remove them to ensure fair competition and maintain the trust of users.

In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach to identify fake reviews. We will use a dataset of reviews collected from online platforms and preprocess them to extract relevant features. These features will be used to train a classifier to distinguish between real and fake reviews.

We will explore various machine learning algorithms and techniques to achieve the best performance in detecting fake reviews. The performance of the classifier will be evaluated using standard metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.

The project will be implemented using Python and various machine learning libraries such as Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow. The code will be hosted on Github, making it accessible and open to contributions from the community.

Overall, this project aims to contribute to the development of techniques for identifying fake reviews and promoting fair competition in online platforms.

To setup and run the code move into the data folder by using the command cd data and then run the code using streamlit
command --> streamlit run <File_Name>.py
The UI is made using the library Streamlit. Which connects with the backend python code and displays the results accordingly.

The frontend.py file contains all the graphs and the results obtained from the dataset using  SVM , Random Forest , Decision Trees , CNN Model and ANN Model.  

We have used LSTM model and BERT model to get fruitful results and Great Accuracy The Accuracy from LSTM Model is 87% and From BERT Model is 90%.
